# Landmark Detection Project

## Description
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for landmark detection using the Keras library in Python. The model is trained on a dataset of 20,000+ images belonging to 20 different classes and tested to detect landmarks in images.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a deep learning model for landmark detection that can accurately classify monument images based on their labels.

## Introduction
Landmark detection is an essential task in computer vision, with numerous applications in fields such as tourism, cultural heritage preservation, and image retrieval. In this project, we use a deep learning approach to build a landmark detection model that can accurately classify monument images.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project contains 20,000 images belonging to 20 different classes. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was preprocessed to ensure that all images were of the same size and format. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were used to increase the size of the dataset.
3. **Model Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to build the landmark detection model. The model consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.
4. **Model Training**: The model was trained using the Keras library in Python. The categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer were used to train the model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using test data, and the accuracy and loss were calculated.

## Features
- Detects various landmarks from images.
- Provides confidence scores for detections.
- Utilizes data augmentation to improve model robustness.
